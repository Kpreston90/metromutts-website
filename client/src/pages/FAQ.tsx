        question: "What do I need to bring for my dog's first visit?",
        answer:
          "For the first visit, please bring proof of up-to-date vaccinations (Rabies, DHPP/Distemper, and Bordetella), your dog's food if they have a special diet, and any medications they may need. We'll handle the rest — including a temperament assessment to find the perfect play group for your pup.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a temperament assessment?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Every new dog goes through a complimentary temperament assessment on their first visit. This helps us understand your dog's play style, energy level, and social preferences so we can match them with the right group. The assessment typically takes about 30 minutes and is included with your free trial day.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is the first day really free?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely! Your dog's first day of daycare is completely free — no strings attached. It's our way of letting you and your pup try us out with zero risk. Just call us at 539-867-3841 or book online to schedule your free trial day.",
      },
      {
        question: "What age does my dog need to be?",
        answer:
          "Dogs must be at least 12 weeks old and have started their vaccination series. Puppies are welcome as long as they meet the vaccination requirements. We have separate play areas for different sizes and energy levels, so even young pups get appropriate socialization.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you accept all breeds?",
        answer:
          "Yes! We welcome all breeds, shapes, and sizes at Metro Mutts. We don't discriminate based on breed. Every dog is evaluated individually during their temperament assessment, and we group dogs by size, play style, and energy level to ensure everyone has a safe, fun experience.",

      {
        question: "What vaccinations are required?",
        answer:
          "All dogs must be current on three core vaccinations: Rabies, DHPP (Distemper, Hepatitis, Parainfluenza, Parvovirus), and Bordetella (kennel cough). We also strongly recommend the Canine Influenza vaccine. Proof of vaccination from your vet must be provided before your dog's first visit.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does my dog need the Canine Influenza vaccine?",
        answer:
          "While not currently required, we strongly recommend the Canine Influenza (CIV H3N2) vaccine for all dogs attending daycare or boarding. Dogs in group settings have higher exposure risk. Talk to your vet about adding this to your dog's vaccination schedule.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I send vaccination records digitally?",
        answer:
          "Yes! You can email vaccination records directly from your vet's office, or snap a photo and text them to us at 539-867-3841. We'll verify everything before your dog's first visit so check-in is smooth and quick.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does my dog need to be spayed or neutered?",
        answer:
          "Dogs over 7 months of age must be spayed or neutered to attend daycare and boarding. This helps maintain a safe, calm environment for all dogs in our care. Puppies under 7 months are welcome while they're still waiting for their procedure.",

        answer:
          "Our daycare operates Monday through Friday, 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM, and Saturday 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Drop-off is available anytime during operating hours, and we ask that all pups be picked up by closing time. Late pick-ups may incur an additional fee.",
      },
      {
        question: "What does a typical day look like?",
        answer:
          "Your dog's day includes structured play sessions with dogs matched by size and temperament, supervised rest periods (because even the most energetic pups need a nap!), fresh water available at all times, and outdoor potty breaks throughout the day. We rotate between active play, enrichment activities, and rest to keep every dog happy and balanced.",
      },
      {
        question: "How are dogs grouped for play?",
        answer:
          "Dogs are grouped by size, energy level, and play style — not just breed. Our staff continuously monitors play groups and adjusts as needed. We have separate areas for small dogs, large dogs, and puppies to ensure everyone plays safely and has fun.",
      },
      {
        question: "What if my dog doesn't do well in group play?",
        answer:
          "Not every dog is a social butterfly, and that's okay! If your dog is shy or needs a slower introduction, our team will work with them at their own pace. We offer one-on-one attention and gradual introductions. If group daycare truly isn't the right fit, we'll be honest with you and discuss alternatives.",

        question: "What's included in overnight boarding?",
        answer:
          "Boarding at Metro Mutts includes a private suite, full days of daycare play, feeding (bring your dog's food or we can provide premium kibble), bedtime potty breaks, and nighttime check-ins by our staff. We also send photo updates so you can see your pup having a great time while you're away.",
      },
      {
        question: "How much does boarding cost?",
        answer:
          "Boarding is $50 per night, which includes everything — private suite, full daycare play during the day, feeding, and overnight supervision. Multi-night stays and frequent boarders may qualify for package discounts. Call us at 539-867-3841 for current specials.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I bring my dog's own bed, toys, or food?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely! We encourage you to bring your dog's regular food to maintain their diet routine. You're welcome to bring a favorite toy or blanket for comfort, though please label everything with your dog's name. We provide cozy bedding in every suite as well.",
      },
      {
        question: "What if my dog needs medication during their stay?",
        answer:
          "We're happy to administer medications during your dog's boarding stay at no extra charge. Just bring the medication in its original packaging with clear dosing instructions from your vet. Our staff is experienced in administering pills, liquids, and topical medications.",

          "Our groomer Jacque offers full-service grooming including baths, haircuts, nail trims, ear cleaning, teeth brushing, de-shedding treatments, and breed-specific styling. We also offer à la carte services if your pup just needs a quick nail trim or bath. Check out our Grooming Gallery to see Jacque's work!",
      },
      {
        question: "How much does grooming cost?",
        answer:
          "Grooming starts at $30 for basic services like bath and nail trim. Full grooming packages vary based on your dog's size, coat type, and the services requested. We'll give you an exact quote when you book. Call 539-867-3841 or book online for pricing specific to your pup.",
      },
      {
        question: "How often should my dog be groomed?",
        answer:
          "It depends on the breed and coat type. Most dogs benefit from professional grooming every 4-6 weeks. Dogs with longer or thicker coats may need more frequent visits, while short-haired breeds can go a bit longer. Jacque can recommend the ideal schedule for your dog during their first appointment.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can my dog do daycare and grooming on the same day?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Many of our clients combine daycare and grooming in a single visit. Drop your dog off for daycare in the morning, and we'll work in their grooming appointment during the day. They'll be fresh, clean, and tired when you pick them up — the best combo!",

      },
      {
        question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
        answer:
          "We ask for at least 24 hours' notice for daycare and grooming cancellations. Boarding reservations require 48 hours' notice for cancellation. Late cancellations or no-shows may be charged a fee. We understand life happens — just give us a call as soon as you know your plans have changed.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer multi-dog discounts?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Families with multiple dogs receive a discount on daycare packages. The second dog from the same household gets a reduced rate. Contact us for specific multi-dog pricing — we love seeing siblings play together!",
